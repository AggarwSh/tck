This model is basically the Chapter 11 Lending example from the spec.  It has a variety of decision tables, invocations, contexts, nested invocations, and qualified names.  Instead of external function PMT it calculates the amortization formula directly.  In lieu of DRD, the file model.doc is a tabular representation of the model.  In the xml, you can disregard the stylesheet directives; they are just used by my execution code.
