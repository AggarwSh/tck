This example was submitted by Falko Menge in July 2016 as an example possible file format for tests.  The example DMN file does not work out to be syntactically correct.  Still working on that.

The input and output format has been criticised as bring too much oriented toward Java, using Java types along with the field values.  The model tells you what the types are / should be, so it is unclear the the input and output would need this.

input/output-001 is the original data in/out that Falko supplied.

input/output-002 is a proposed simplification that removes the types and extra things from the files.
